            The seismic changes of 2020—including the Black Lives Matter uprising
            around racial justice—has also provided Styles with an opportunity for
            personal growth. “I think it’s a time for opening up and learning and
            listening,” he says. “I’ve been trying to read and educate myself so
            that in 20 years I’m still doing the right things and taking the right
            steps. I believe in karma, and I think it’s just a time right now
            where we could use a little more kindness and empathy and patience
            with people, be a little more prepared to listen and grow.” Meanwhile,
            Styles’s euphoric single “Watermelon Sugar” became something of an
            escapist anthem for this dystopian summer of 2020. The video,
            featuring Styles (dressed in ’70s-­flavored Gucci and Bode) cavorting
            with a pack of beach-babe girls and boys, was shot in January, before
            lockdown rules came into play. By the time it was ready to be released
            in May, a poignant epigraph had been added: “This video is dedicated
            to touching.” Styles is looking forward to touring again, when “it’s
            safe for everyone,” because, as he notes, “being up against people is
            part of the whole thing. You can’t really re-create it in any way.”
            But it hasn’t always been so. Early in his career, Styles was so
            stricken with stage fright that he regularly threw up preperformance.
            “I just always thought I was going to mess up or something,” he
            remembers. “But I’ve felt really lucky to have a group of incredibly
            generous fans. They’re generous emotionally—and when they come to the
            show, they give so much that it creates this atmosphere that I’ve
            always found so loving and accepting.”
